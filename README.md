Independent Work Day

AM Hours

I kicked off the morning by running through a list of my unexplored coding related concepts, frameworks, and services. I spent well over an hour skimming the surface of each one to get a better idea of what I would be able to accomplish in the next 8..err 7ish hours and narrowed my choices down to 3: Vue.js, data structures/algorithms, and AWS. While it was tempting to delve into a new framework I wasn't sure if having a day's worth of knowledge for a given framework would benefit me. The data structures and algorithms would be super useful for whiteboard interviews and gaining a better understanding of programming in general. I came some promising resources that I purchased from [Udemy]("https://www.udemy.com/learning-data-structures-in-javascript-from-scratch/"). After realizing that interviews for a Junior Web Developer position might not have questions on those concepts I thought more about what I would be working on as a Jr. Developer. Most web companies don't host their own websites and one of the most popular, versatile hosting services these days is AWS. I've had an interest in figuring out how to use it for a while now, but they offer a lot and it was overwhelming to login and have 50+ types of instances and hundreds, if not thousands, of settings at your disposal.

In order to power through the I spent time setting up an account via [GitHub's Student Developer Pack]("https://education.github.com/pack") for a $150 credit ontop of the 12 months of open access to the free tier.
